Wandering Fighters is a simple mod that modifies the Wandering Trader mob to scream at you and become aggressive when it's attacked.

Wandering Traders have had enough of the undeserved hate they receive. They will now fight back against everything. Do not kill it or it's llamas ever again.

Oh, and in case you were wondering, they're almost unkillable. These guys are hardened experts that have been through tough situations.
